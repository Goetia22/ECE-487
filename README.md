# ECE-487

Lab 1: 7-Segment display. Possible updates in the future as I better understand the hardware.

Lab 2: LED Multiplexing. Uses the same hardware definitions as Lab 1, extended a bit to account for new pins utilized.

Lab 3: VGA Bouncing ball. Extended into lab 6 (PONG game) due to lab similarities. Should work with a standard VGA plug.

Lab 4: Temporarily Omitted

Lab 5: Music player. Expanding on the [unpleasant sounding] siren in lab 4, I followed FPGA 4 fun's guide to make music on my FPGA board.

Project: Ohmmeter-instrument. By tapping various pads set to inputs, you can play back music! Uses lab 5 as a base.
