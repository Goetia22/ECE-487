# ECE-487

Lab 1: 7-Segment display. Possible updates in the future as I better understand the hardware.

Lab 2: LED Multiplexing. Uses the same hardware definitions as Lab 1, extended a bit to account for new pins utilized.

Lab 3: VGA Bouncing ball. Extended into lab 6 (PONG game) due to lab similarities. Should work with a standard VGA plug.
